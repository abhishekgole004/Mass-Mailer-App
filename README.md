This application is designed to automate the handling of Excel files (XLSX) uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. It utilizes the power of AWS Lambda to efficiently process these files and extract data. It's capable of sending personalized emails to recipients extracted from the Excel files. 
n this project, I've used:
	•	AWS Lambda for serverless computing.
	•	Amazon S3 for object storage.
	•	openpyxl library for Excel file manipulation.
	•	Amazon SES for sending emails.
